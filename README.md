# bananadine

A Matrix bot written in Clojure

## Installation

Clone the repo and run `lein deps`

## Usage

Run `lein run -- -c config.edn` to start the app  
Config is expected to be an edn file containing `:db-dir` and `:log-dir`  
A default config file is included in this repository, using `$CWD/db` as the log directory.  

To register a user or update stored credentials, use `--register` or `--update` respectively.  
Note successful registration will require a host domain `-d`, a user `-u`, and a password `-p`.  
Host domain is the domain of the host, not the full URL. Matrix instances hosted on non-root URLs are not currently supported (e.g. `https://my-cool-host.com/matrix-instance/`).  
Providing the user credentials as CLI options is very insecure, so you probably shouldn't run this bot anywhere for any reason in its current form.  
This shall change in the future when I get around to moving provision of these credentials into environment variables.  


The canonical way to develop (and currently to run) this bot is using CIDER/Emacs (or another NREPL workflow).  
Require `bananadine.bootstrap` and `mount.core :refer start` then `(start)` to initialise the component system and start handling events.
